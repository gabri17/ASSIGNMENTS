model is stable only if arrival < departure, otherwise queue will grow indefinitevly long.

arrival = lambda (a)
departure = mu (d)

statistics:
- p = a/d: utilization buffer
- average number of packets in the system in stationary
conditions (after initialization, on long term) p * (1-p)
- probability it contains i customers (queue + server): (1-p) * p^i
